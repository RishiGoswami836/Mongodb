# Data Visualization Questions and Purpose

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Line Chart
**Question:**  
- **How have attendance rates changed over time across different periods or years for each category or student group?**

**Purpose:**  
- To visualize trends and compare how a metric (e.g., attendance rate) evolves over time for different groups or categories.

---

## 2. Grouped Column Chart
**Question:**  
- **What is the comparison of a specific metric (e.g., attendance rates or student count) across different categories or student groups over multiple time periods?**

**Purpose:**  
- To compare multiple groups or time periods side by side, showcasing how the values vary across them.

---

## 3. Donut Chart
**Question:**  
- **What is the distribution or proportion of categories, student groups, or metrics (e.g., attendance rates or student counts) within a given time period or district?**

**Purpose:**  
- To visualize how a total is divided into different categories or parts, typically to see the relative sizes of each part in comparison to the whole.

---

## 4. Heatmap
**Question:**  
- **How do values (e.g., attendance rates) vary across different dimensions like districts and student groups for a given time period?**

**Purpose:**  
- To visualize data in a matrix format where color intensity represents the value, helping to identify patterns, clusters, or anomalies.

---

## 5. Scatter Plot
**Question:**  
- **What is the relationship or correlation between two numerical variables (e.g., student count and attendance rate) across different categories or districts?**

**Purpose:**  
- To visualize the relationship between two continuous variables and see if there's a pattern, trend, or correlation between them.

---

## 6. Word Cloud
**Question:**  
- **What are the most common or frequent values in a categorical variable (e.g., student groups or districts)?**

**Purpose:**  
- To show the frequency of terms or categories in a visually appealing format, with the size of each word representing its frequency.

---

## 7. Stacked Column Chart
**Question:**  
- **How does a metric (e.g., attendance rates) break down into different parts (e.g., student groups) across multiple districts or categories over time?**

**Purpose:**  
- To visualize how each part of a whole contributes to the total value across different categories or time periods.

---

## 8. Discrete Area Chart
**Question:**  
- **How do the attendance rates for different student groups or categories evolve across discrete time periods (e.g., different school years)?**

**Purpose:**  
- To show how multiple data series fill up areas under a curve, with different segments or areas representing different groups or categories over time.

---

## 9. Number
**Question:**  
- **What is the total, average, or other aggregate value for a metric (e.g., total student count, average attendance rate) in a specific period or category?**

**Purpose:**  
- To display a single, aggregated number (e.g., sum, average) that gives a quick insight into a key metric, such as total student count or average attendance.
